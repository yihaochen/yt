Light Ray Generator
===================

.. note::

    Development of the LightRay module has been moved to the Trident
    package. This version is deprecated and will be removed from yt
    in a future release. See https://github.com/trident-project/trident
    for further information.

Light rays are similar to light cones (:ref:`light-cone-generator`) in how
they stack multiple datasets together to span a redshift interval.  Unlike
light cones, which stack randomly oriented projections from each
dataset to create synthetic images, light rays use thin pencil beams to
simulate QSO sight lines.  A sample script can be found in the cookbook
under :ref:`cookbook-light_ray`.

A ray segment records the information of all grid cells intersected by the
ray as well as the path length, ``dl``, of the ray through the cell.  Column
densities can be calculated by multiplying physical densities by the path
length.

Configuring the Light Ray Generator
-----------------------------------

Below follows the creation of a light ray from multiple datasets stacked
together.  However, a light ray can also be made from a single dataset.
For an example of this, see :ref:`cookbook-single-dataset-light-ray`.

The arguments required to instantiate a
:class:`~yt.analysis_modules.cosmological_observation.light_ray.light_ray.LightRay`
object are the same as
those required for a
:class:`~yt.analysis_modules.cosmological_observation.light_cone.light_cone.LightCone`
object: the simulation parameter file, the
simulation type, the nearest redshift, and the furthest redshift.

.. code-block:: python

  from yt.analysis_modules.cosmological_observation.api import LightRay
  lr = LightRay("enzo_tiny_cosmology/32Mpc_32.enzo",
                simulation_type="Enzo",
                near_redshift=0.0, far_redshift=0.1)

Additional keyword arguments are:

* ``use_minimum_datasets`` (*bool*): If True, the minimum number of datasets
  is used to connect the initial and final redshift.  If false, the light
  ray solution will contain as many entries as possible within the redshift
  interval.  Default: True.

* ``deltaz_min`` (*float*):  Specifies the minimum Delta-z between
  consecutive datasets in the returned list.  Default: 0.0.

* ``max_box_fraction`` (*float*):  In terms of the size of the domain, the
  maximum length a light ray segment can be in order to span the redshift interval
  from one dataset to another.  If using a zoom-in simulation, this parameter can
  be set to the length of the high resolution region so as to limit ray segments
  to that size.  If the high resolution region is not cubical, the smallest side
  should be used.  Default: 1.0 (the size of the box)

* ``minimum_coherent_box_fraction`` (*float*): Use to specify the minimum
  length of a ray, in terms of the size of the domain, before the trajectory
  is re-randomized.  Set to 0 to have ray trajectory randomized for every
  dataset.  Set to np.inf (infinity) to use a single trajectory for the
  entire ray.  Default: 0.0.

* ``time_data`` (*bool*): Whether or not to include time outputs when
  gathering datasets for time series.  Default: True.

* ``redshift_data`` (*bool*): Whether or not to include redshift outputs
  when gathering datasets for time series.  Default: True.

Making Light Ray Data
---------------------

Once the LightRay object has been instantiated, the
:func:`~yt.analysis_modules.cosmological_observation.light_ray.light_ray.LightRay.make_light_ray`
function will trace out the rays in each dataset and collect information for all the
fields requested.  The output file will be an HDF5 file containing all the
cell field values for all the cells that were intersected by the ray.  A
single LightRay object can be used over and over to make multiple
randomizations, simply by changing the value of the random seed with the
``seed`` keyword.

.. code-block:: python

  lr.make_light_ray(seed=8675309,
                    fields=['temperature', 'density'],
                    use_peculiar_velocity=True)

The keyword arguments are:

* ``seed`` (*int*): Seed for the random number generator.  Default: None.

* ``periodic`` (*bool*): If True, ray trajectories will make use of periodic
  boundaries.  If False, ray trajectories will not be periodic.  Default : True.

* ``left_edge`` (iterable of *floats* or *YTArray*): The left corner of the
  region in which rays are to be generated.  If None, the left edge will be
  that of the domain.  Default: None.

* ``right_edge`` (iterable of *floats* or *YTArray*): The right corner of
  the region in which rays are to be generated.  If None, the right edge
  will be that of the domain.  Default: None.

* ``min_level`` (*int*): The minimum refinement level of the spatial region in
  which the ray passes.  This can be used with zoom-in simulations where the
  high resolution region does not keep a constant geometry.  Default: None.

* ``start_position`` (*list* of floats): Used only if creating a light ray
  from a single dataset.  The coordinates of the starting position of the
  ray.  Default: None.

* ``end_position`` (*list* of floats): Used only if creating a light ray
  from a single dataset.  The coordinates of the ending position of the ray.
  Default: None.

* ``trajectory`` (*list* of floats): Used only if creating a light ray
  from a single dataset.  The (r, theta, phi) direction of the light ray.
  Use either ``end_position`` or ``trajectory``, not both.
  Default: None.

* ``fields`` (*list*): A list of fields for which to get data.
  Default: None.

* ``solution_filename`` (*string*): Path to a text file where the
  trajectories of each subray is written out.  Default: None.

* ``data_filename`` (*string*): Path to output file for ray data.
  Default: None.

* ``use_peculiar_velocity`` (*bool*): If True, the doppler redshift from
  the peculiar velocity of gas along the ray is calculated and added to the
  cosmological redshift as the "effective" redshift.
  Default: True.

* ``redshift`` (*float*): Used with light rays made from single datasets to
  specify a starting redshift for the ray.  If not used, the starting
  redshift will be 0 for a non-cosmological dataset and the dataset redshift
  for a cosmological dataset.  Default: None.

* ``njobs`` (*int*): The number of parallel jobs over which the slices for
  the halo mask will be split.  Choose -1 for one processor per individual
  slice and 1 to have all processors work together on each projection.
  Default: 1

Useful Tips for Making LightRays
--------------------------------

Below are some tips that may come in handy for creating proper LightRays.

How many snapshots do I need?
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The number of snapshots required to traverse some redshift interval depends
on the simulation box size and cosmological parameters.  Before running an
expensive simulation only to find out that you don't have enough outputs
to span the redshift interval you want, have a look at
:ref:`planning-cosmology-simulations`.  The functionality described there
will allow you to calculate the precise number of snapshots and specific
redshifts at which they should be written.

My snapshots are too far apart!
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The ``max_box_fraction`` keyword, provided when creating the `Lightray`,
allows the user to control how long a ray segment can be for an
individual dataset.  Be default, the `LightRay` generator will try to
make segments no longer than the size of the box to avoid sampling the
same structures more than once.  However, this can be increased in the
case that the redshift interval between datasets is longer than the
box size.  Increasing this value should be done with caution as longer
ray segments run a greater risk of coming back to somewhere near their
original position.

What if I have a zoom-in simulation?
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

A zoom-in simulation has a high resolution region embedded within a
larger, low resolution volume.  In this type of simulation, it is likely
that you will want the ray segments to stay within the high resolution
region.  To do this, you must first specify the size of the high
resolution region when creating the `LightRay` using the
``max_box_fraction`` keyword.  This will make sure that
the calculation of the spacing of the segment datasets only takes into
account the high resolution region and not the full box size.  If your
high resolution region is not a perfect cube, specify the smallest side.
Then, in the call to
:func:`~yt.analysis_modules.cosmological_observation.light_ray.light_ray.LightRay.make_light_ray`,
use the ``left_edge`` and ``right_edge`` keyword arguments to specify the
precise location of the high resolution region.

Technically speaking, the ray segments should no longer be periodic
since the high resolution region is only a sub-volume within the
larger domain.  To make the ray segments non-periodic, set the
``periodic`` keyword to False.  The LightRay generator will continue
to generate randomly oriented segments until it finds one that fits
entirely within the high resolution region.  If you have a high
resolution region that can move and change shape slightly as structure
forms, use the `min_level` keyword to mandate that the ray segment only
pass through cells that are refined to at least some minimum level.

If the size of the high resolution region is not large enough to
span the required redshift interval, the `LightRay` generator can
be configured to treat the high resolution region as if it were
periodic simply by setting the ``periodic`` keyword to True.  This
option should be used with caution as it will lead to the creation
of disconnected ray segments within a single dataset.

I want a continuous trajectory over the entire ray.
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Set the ``minimum_coherent_box_fraction`` keyword argument to a very
large number, like infinity (`numpy.inf`).

.. note::

   As of :code:`yt-3.0`, the functionality for recording properties of
   the nearest halo to each element of the ray no longer exists.  This
   is still available in :code:`yt-2.x`.  If you would like to use this
   feature in :code:`yt-3.x`, help is needed to port it over.  Contact
   the yt-users mailing list if you are interested in doing this.

What Can I do with this?
------------------------

Once you have created a `LightRay`, you can use it to generate an
:ref:`absorption_spectrum`.  In addition, you can use the
:class:`~yt.visualization.plot_modifications.RayCallback` to
:ref:`annotate-ray` on your plots.
